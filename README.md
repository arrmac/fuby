# Fuby
### Functional Ruby

Fuby is a hybrid functional/object-oriented programming language with the same
syntax as Ruby, although pretty different semantics in many aspects.

It targets the Rubinius VM, so you need to install Rubinius to run it.

It is just an idea for now. Some of its features might or might not be:

* Pervasive immutability
* Controlled IO
* Methods as first-class functions
* [Some] laziness
* Monads

Keep checking this repository for new ideas, code examples and so on :)

## Installation

After installing Rubinius, install Fuby as a gem:

    $ gem install fuby

## Usage

    $ fuby my_program.fb
